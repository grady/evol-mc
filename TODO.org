* DONE Implementation
* TODO Simulations
We need to come up with a modest set of informative and interesting simulations.
** Simple Metropolis [0/2]
 - [ ] variance
 - [ ] population size
** Evolutionary MC [0/3]
 - [ ] Crossover / Mutation rate: (0.5,0.5), (0.75, 0.25), (.90, .10)
 - [ ] mutation scale: (variance of additive random noise): runif3, runif4
 - [ ] population size (number of temps): 2, 5, 10
 - [ ] iterations: 5k, 10k, 50k, 100k
** Parallel tempering [0/2]
 - [ ] iterations: 5k, 10k, 50k, 100k
 - [ ] population size: 2, 5, 10
