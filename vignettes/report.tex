\label{sec:software}


We present the R package evolMC, which is a framework for doing
Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulations. It includes explicit support for
several MCMC algorithms, including Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs,
parallel tempering, and the evolutionary updating methods.

The package aims to provide a general framework for constructing a
chain, leaving it up to the user to provide the specific pieces
specific to the problem. The user must first define a \emph{state
object} and then implement a number of functions which act on this
state object. In many traditional cases this state object can simply
be a vector of reals, but any R object (e.g. a phylogenetic tree
object defined by a 3rd-party package) can be used. The functions
provided by evolMC will eventually produce a \emph{chain} object,
which is simply an R list where each element is an instance of the
state object.

\section{evolMC}
\label{sec:evolmc}
The evolMC package includes a vignette demonstrating a few basic use
cases, with example code. Here we briefly discuss the architectural
vision underlying the package and a few of the most important
functions.

evolMC was designed to be as flexible as possible, and hence it
operates on a quite abstract level. It is written in a very functional
style of programming; most of the important functions in evolMC accept
functions as arguments and return new functions. An important goal was
for the user to be free to use whatever object they wish to represent
a realization of the random element in question. This departs from
many existing R MCMC packages, which require vector- or
array-type structures for the random elements in question.

The main job of the user of evolMC is to define a few basic functions
which can interact in specified ways with whatever object is selected
to represent states of the chain. For example, the user will often
need to implement a function which evaluates a log-densitiy for a
given state. Using the routines provided by evolMC, one will then
manipulate these functions, eventually producing a function which
implements some desired MCMC algorithm.

For example, the core function in evolMC is
\texttt{iterate(n,f,x)}. This function is also among the least
interesting, because it simply creates a list where the $k$-th element
is $f^{k-1}(x)$. (Function exponentiation means iterated application
here.) If the provided function f is ``carefully selected'' then the
resulting chain might have ``desirable properties''. Of course, we are
likely interested in the case where the ``desirable property'' in
question is that the resulting list represents a sample from some target
distribution.  Other functions in the package help one to construct
``carefully selected'' functions {\tt f}.

Perhaps the most basic MCMC algorithm is the Gibbs sampler. Suppose we
want to sample from $[x,y]$. If we can sample from $[x|y]$ and
$[y|x]$, then we can implement a Gibbs sampler. To do this one need
only implement functions {\tt rxt} and {\tt ryx}, which do the
respective sampling. These
functions should accept the current state as their first argument, and
return a new state object with the relavant changes made.

Once one has these functions, the gibbs function can be used to
produce a new updating function which will implement the Gibbs
algorithm. The basic signature is {\tt gibbs(...)}. The ...  argument
allows one to provide any number of updating functions; in our case we
have two, {\tt rxt} and {\tt ryx}. The result of {\tt gibbs(rxy,ryx)}
is a new ``carefully selected'' function with signature
\texttt{function(state)} which acts as a Gibbs updater. If called
repeatedly (e.g. by iterate) it will alternate between using {\tt rxy}
and {\tt ryx} to update the state.\footnote{The sequential choice of
  updating functions is the default mode of operation for the function
  returned by {\tt gibbs}. It can also stochastically select an
  updating function according to provided weights.}

A second important algorithm is the Metropolis algorithm. The function
{\tt metropolis} helps one to construct an updating function which
implements Metropolis-Hastings. To use this function one must first implement:
the log-density function for the target distribution ({\tt ln.d}); a proposal
generator function ({\tt r.prop}); and (if required) a log-density function for the
proposal generator ({\tt ln.d.prop}). A call {\tt metropolis(ln.d,
  r.prop, ln.d.prop)} will return a ``carefully selected'' function
(with signature {\tt function(state)}), which implements the
Metropolis-Hastings scheme you have defined.

These three basic building blocks can be used to construct a suprising
number of more advanced MCMC algorithms, and indeed many of the more
advanced agorithms provided by evolMC are constructed using only these pieces.
